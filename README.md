### Example
Look in the example director of a working configuration for the states of Colorado and California 

The brackets were taken from: 
[Colorado](https://leg.colorado.gov/agencies/legislative-council-staff/individual-income-tax%C2%A0) 

and 

[California](https://www.ftb.ca.gov/forms/2022/2022-540-tax-rate-schedules.pdf) 
__** California is 2022, I have not found the oficial 2023 schedule **__

### Tax Brackets and Tax Calculation
- the configuration used the Married Filing Jointly Tax Brackets bracket
- Allowance is set to 1 for Federal, State and local
- Insurance is Pre-Tax
- Taxable income is use base on the Standard Deduction for Married Filing Jointly
- Taxable income is use to calculate the State taxes! __** could be wrong for other states then CO **__
